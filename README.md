# Congratulations!

You have finished all the tasks! That's so awesome. You now know everything you need to start creating your own extensions! If you'd like to keep working on the extension that you've created during the workshop, check the section below.

## Step 5+
Your extension is one of a kind, you won't find anything similar in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) (at least in the time of writing this). If you wish, you can extend it, clean it up and publish! Think about all the fame and fortune!
If you'll decide to stick to the [smogalert.pl](http://smogalert.pl) API, *make sure to give them some credit*! You can also request access to the data directly from UMWM (more info [here](http://www.malopolska.pl/Obywatel/EKO-prognozaMalopolski/Malopolska/Strony/jak-powstaja-prognozy.aspx)).

If you are wondering how to extend this extension, check all the "Extra time left?" sections from the previous steps + my ideas below:
- drawing some pretty charts using pollution data,
- providing a forecast (based on the historic data),
- monitoring multiple locations.
